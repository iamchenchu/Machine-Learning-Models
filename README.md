# Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains models in a virtual environment, It will have at least 1 model for each concept in the Machine Learning

# Supervised Learning Models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks
# Unsupervised Learning Models: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering
# Reinforcement Learning Models: Deep Q Network (DQN), Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods
# Deep Learning Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)


More concepts will be added soon...
